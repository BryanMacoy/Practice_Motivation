    <p>It is easy to get distracted with the pleasures of life. It is also easy to lose everything you thought you earned or deserve. What do you do if everything falls apart and you don't get what you want or expect? How do you stay determined to better your future without feeling like a victim? Resiliency is a blessing, a gift, and a resource that can prove invaluable to our journey in life.</p>
